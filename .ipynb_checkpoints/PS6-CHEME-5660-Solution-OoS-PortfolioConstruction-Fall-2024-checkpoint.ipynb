    "# PS6: Simulation of Ticker Picker Portfolios\n",
    "In the lecture, we developed the `ticker picker` agent, which learned by analyzing historical daily data sequences the probability that a ticker would outperform an alternative investment over a specified N-trading day period. We considered two scenarios: when the `ticker picker` was unaware of risk and when the agents were risk-aware (where risk, in this context, was measured in powers of $\\beta$). \n",
    "\n",
    "We had the agents rank their top-10 portfolios, and from that, we computed the probability of a ticker appearing in a top-10 portfolio. We saved all this preference data to avoid rerunning those calculations here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "In this problem set, we will use agents trained using `SPY` as the alternative investment to select our portfolio's stocks (or ETFs). This is a different, potentially more exciting set of agents than we constructed in the lecture examples. In particular, we'll query the `SPY` ticker-picker agents and have them vote for a list of tickers to include in our portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ given an investment budget $\\mathcal{B}$. We then compare the performance of our portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ (assuming equally weighted) to a portfolio consisting of `SPY` alone.\n",

    "* Switching the `preference_dataset` variable may lead to different performance of the portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ relative to `SPY` alone. We expect that while the wealth generated by the risk-aware portfolio is similar to or lower than the risk-blind selection, the performance variance will also be less. Thus, a risk-sensitive agent is willing to trade return for less uncertainty.\n",
    "* __Fun idea__: Our portfolio allocation is equally weighted. A better comparison would be to compute optimal weights $\\omega_{i}$ values by solving the minimum variance allocation problem we explored earlier (we leave this to you). Curious to see what happens.\n",
    "* __Another fun idea__: We developed the ticker pickers for a limited set of assets. I'm curious to see what happens if we expand the asset set beyond the 30 or so we picked, and re-run this analysis. "
